                    <p>The first graphic development engine were written for the console and couldn't be used for any other system, thatr all change with the height of the arade games and the inbuilt processor Video games companies would produce their own engines for their software allow to make more games. Moving forward in the 80's and the home console several 2D first party engine were built, the was the Pinball Construction Set by BudgeCo., ASCII's War Game Construction Kit, Thunder Force Construction, Adventure Construction Set, Garry Kitchen's GameMaker, Wargame Construction Set, Shoot'Em-Up Construction Kit, Arcade Game Construction Kit were the major Engine that were created in the 80's.</p>
                    <p>The creator's of Doom and Quake,id Software, in 1998 decided to sell license their engine, called Unreal, this gave them an alternate revenue stream allowing them to take more time between games as they had more money to work with. Third party Engines were a win win system this allowed the owner to create better game as they had more time to do so and smaller developer to used advanced and well built engine to use. third party software was very popular for first person shooters and rpg games like The elder scrolls franchise. The major third party software today is id Software's Unreal engine, unity and the cryengine these are available for purchase online.</p>

                    <p>An essential part of any video game is characters, Mario is a good way to look at how model design has changed his first incarnation he was blocky, very blocky, and had a very basic colour pallet with white overalls and cap with a red shirt and red shoes. this was due to the minimal colour pallet of the NES, move forward to his next game and he already looks a lot more human with whites in his eyes and more colour looking less blocky. moving forward to 3D designs and he's lost and visable block texture and he's very human like apart from being cartoonish. another good series to look at is Tomb Raider, her first model design being famous for having pyramid breasts and looking very unlife like, but the latest reboot of the series uses Motation capture software bring lara croft to life.</p>
