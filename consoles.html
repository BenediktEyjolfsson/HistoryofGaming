                    <p>Before Home Consoles became the stanard form of gaming, Arcade machines were the most popular form of gaming. The first machine built was for a game called galaxy game in 1971, but it wasn't until 1872 when Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney founded Atari and created Pong. During the 70's and early 80's Arcade game became very popular the world over. The business, by the time home consoles started to appear, was wotrth $8 billion or $21.4 billion ajusted for inflation, this was not to last as home gaming kept advancing the arcade business began to fade and by 1991, revune was down in the US alone to $2.1 Billion or $3.8 billion today</p>
                    <p>During the 90's Arcade fighter took off becuase of their simply controls allowed for co-op fighters like Mortal combat and street fighter, to be quick to learn and fun to play some what reviving the business for a short while.</p>

                    <p>In 1972 Magnavox released the Magnavox Odyssey, this was the first console that was able to connect to the TV, The first design of the Odyssey was to have a huge amount of switches to change the version of the diffrent games that the Odyssey had due to the lack of a CPU, this was scrapped and the final design had the player would switch game version by placing peice of see through plastic over the screen. The console had a moderate release selling roughly 100,000 copies, it became more popular with the release of pong on it's system allowing the game previous available on a single machine for loads of people, was now available for everyone.</p>
                    <p>The second generation of Consoles saw much improvement from the previous generation, the addition of a microprocessor allowed for many improcement like AI and ROM cartridges so that many games could be played on one console. the major steps were Simple sprites, basic colours either 1-bit or 4-bit and three channel audio. The only major improvement since the second generation is changing from cartridge to disc in the forth generation with the Commodore CDTVbeing the first to fully exclusively use the new media format.</p>

                    <p>The first handheld console was the Microvision in 1979, it had no colour and it had no processor so the all the game funtion were done by the cartridges. there would be a few more handheld consoles to coem but they only had 4 or 5 games on them. Handheld console would not become popular until 1989 when the gameboy was realeased in total 118.69 million sale were made including the 1998 version of the console, the Gameboy color, this console would dominate the portable console market</p>
                    <p>Nintendo's Gameboy continued to dominate the portable console market with their new console the Gameboy Advanced and DS but only 10 day after the DS's Japan release Sony would bring out the Playstation Portable, although it only sold 80 million compared to the DS's 154 million this was a first for portable consoles as no one had challenged Nintedo's monopoly before.</p>

                    <p>Consoles War started in the 90's between Nintendo's Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega's Genesis and mega drive, now at this point I should point out that the companies themselves were not in direct competition but it was the fans whom would argue online about which console they thought was better. In more recent year Nintendo and Sega has drop to the back and Sony's Playstation and Microsoft's xbox has been the latest to be brought in to this ongoing arguement.</p>
                    <p>Nintendo and Sega's fans had been arguing over which console was better for about a decade when the next generation of console had been released, sony's playstation 2 was an instant hit putting to end a long arguement. Sony's Playstation 2 is the best selling console of all time, with over 155 million consoles sold and although Xbox had released it's first console it was 6 years later and was too little, too late and only sold 24 million, but it did gain a sizeable fan base and restarted an old arguement with new face, playstation and Xbox.</p>
                    <p>As Playstation 2 and the orginal Xbox was phasing out as the next generation of console was appering in stores the question was which console will be better with specs being so close, Xbox slightly out peforming the Playstaion, the real answer would be found in the software and exclusive content. Halo, Xbox flagship Exclusive series, was created by bungie an was popular on the Orginal Xbox and only grew on the Xbox 360. On the other side Playstaion had released a new game little big planet a sandbox game with doll like caracters. Xbox sales were 84 million and Playstation had just under 84 million sales.</p>
                    <p>The latest generation of consoles has been out for a few years now and it appers that Playstaion is winning having the better hardware and it's showing with 53.4 million consoles sold to Xbox's somewhere between 25 and 30 million consoles sold. when the next generation of consoles starts to apper I would like to see what people thought was the better consoles of this generation and what they think are the make and break moments of each console.</p>
