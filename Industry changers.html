                    <p>The microprocessor was the first big invention in video games as this meant that each game had to have it's own processing unit inside the cartridge. this was great for the cost of buying video games, console were more expensive but you would only buy one of those where as you would buy many cartridges which was now cheaper.</p>
                    <p>The controller has changed so much since the Magnavox Odyssey. The first change is Nintendo's NES controller when they changed from using the joystick to a d-pad this made the controller small and easier to use, this style would be used by most best selling console upto today. bumpers another first by Nintendo was added to their SNES controller allowing for more feature to be added to games. triggers another extra to give players more control was first introduced on the Playstaion 1 controller. PLaystion is also the first to have dual analog controllers this allwed to player to have more free movement and to look other place than straight ahead. Wireless controllers are great for gamers as it means that peole are tripping on the wire or accidently pulling it out, because it doesn't exsist, but the first wireless controller wasn't the gamecube addon but in fact it was the Atari CX-42 for the Atari 2600 it was horribly inefficient and the reciver was this big box that didn't look tidy at all.</p>
                    <p>Virtual Reality is the new latest big thing in video games, with models like the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive, with games like Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes and Job Simulator both demonstration game to show VR potential, even big titles are getting in on the hype with Batman: arkham VR and Resident Evil: Biohazard 7. Virtual Reality may be new big thing but it not, not new to the industry it has been a dream since the 50's, but the first big attement in video game was Nintendo's Virtual Boy, it made people nauseous and dizzy after 5 minutes, the console was dropped and they haven't try again since.</p>

                    <p>For the first big inventor we are going back a bit further than you think, Charles Babbage in 1823 was given £1700 or about £94,336 in todays money by the government to build an autonomous engine to make calculaing income and costs quicker for the rapidly growing empire. he didn't succeed as he miss vitail peice of technology that would be invented over the the next century. </p>
                    <p>Alan Turing and Tommy flowers were the next peole too take on the challenge oof built a successful computer, during world war II, the smartest mind of the british empire gather in a small place called bletchley park, Milton Keynes. This is where Alan turing worked with amny other people listenig to Nazi communication listening for vitail information, the Nazi being smart used a hard to crack code, german high command used the impossible to crack Lorenz cipher, Aln Turing whist working had an idea to create a machine that autonomously could solve the codes the Germans used, he worked with Tommy Flowers a Post office Engineer to build Colossus which broke the Lorenz cipher and saved countless lives at Normany landing in 1944. Tommy Flowers llive until 1998 and died peacfully, as for Turing he was prosecuted for being gay and in 1954 committed suicide.</p>
                    <p>Ted Hoff, was an employee at Intel, an came up with the Idea of using a universal processor rather than diffrent design circuits. Hoff along with Masatoshi Shima, Stanley Mazor and Federico Faggin designed and built the Intel 4004, this started the what is now known as the microprocessor revolution. Teff Hoff would become First Intel Fellow, the top technician of the company. Masatoshi Shima would go on to help design the 8008 and 8080 processors. Stanley Mazor worked for intel for a few more years before going on to teach at Stanford and santa clare, then Training director at BEA Systems. Federico Faggin would go on to help design the 8008, 4040 and 8080 microprocessors and the with Masatoshi Shima create the Z80 microprocessor and the Z8 micro controller at Zilog, which he was founder.</p>
